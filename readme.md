## Licence
This software is licensed under the **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)**. This license allows users to use, modify, and distribute software without any restrictions or compulsory payments for the licensed code. The license is designed to ensure that modified versions of the code it covers remain free and open source. It also attempts to spread copyleftism by mandating the use of the GPL v3 for distributed adaptations of GPL v3-licensed code.

Under the GPLv3, there are four freedoms that every user should have: the freedom to use the software for any purpose, the freedom to change the software to suit your needs, the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and the freedom to share the changes you make. When a program offers users all of these freedoms, we call it free software. Developers who write software can release it under the terms of the GNU GPL. When they do, it will be free software and stay free software, no matter who changes or distributes the program. We call this copyleft: the software is copyrighted, but instead of using those rights to restrict users like proprietary software does, we use them to ensure that every user has freedom.
